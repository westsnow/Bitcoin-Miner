1. enter this folder. It contains an eclipse project and some documents.

2. open eclipse, and import this project.

3. import external akka libs to your project.

4. The code has two entry files(ServerMain.scala and ClientMain.scala ).
To run ServerMain.scala, you should define the number of zeros in the coins you wanna find, and the server's running time. 
For example "java -jar serverMain.jar 7 300" ask the server to run 300 seconds to find the coins containing 7 zeros as prefix.(the default parameter is 5 and 30)
Importantly, you should modify the ServerMain.java, because you should define your own ip address, you can define it by modify the 38th line 'hostname = "127.0.0.1"'. And the default port is 11111.
To run ClientMain.scala, there is one parameter---server'ip. So, you just run like this "java -jar clientMain.jar 127.0.0.1"

5.You can also use sbt to run my code. Make sure you have set build.sbt correctly. A sample build.sbt is contained in forRunning folder.

6. If you have difficulty running my code, please email me at hbwestsnow@gmail.com
